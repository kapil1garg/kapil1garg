# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kapil!
I'm a postdoc at the University of California, Irvine, advised by [Anne Marie Piper](https://ics.uci.edu/~ampiper/index.html) and [Erik Sudderth](https://ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/). My research in human-computer interaction and machine learning aims to develop systems that make accessing visual information interactive and more reliable for blind and low-vision people. I completed my Ph.D. in [Technology and Social Behavior](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/) (dual degree in CS and Communication Studies) working with Professors [Haoqi Zhang](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq/) and [Darren Gergle](http://dgergle.soc.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University. My dissertation work introduced _Situated Practice Systems_ that help novice workers develop their work practice and self-regulation skills for complex work. See my [website](https://www.kgarg.com/) for more.

## ðŸ”¬ Research systems
Systems related to my dissertation work include:
- [Interactive CAP Notes](https://github.com/NUDelta/interactive-soap-notes): a new note-taking tool that provides mentors with structures for understanding how their students are working and for computationally-backed follow-up practices to be described in natural language (e.g., suggesting peers who can help with prototype bugs --> creates a group DM to discuss).
- [Orchestration Script Authoring and Diagnosis Interface](https://github.com/NUDelta/orchestration-scripting-interfaces): a way to model expert diagnosis practices for work situations and reason about them when issues arise (e.g,. when a worker is blocked on making progress on prototyping). Done with my [wonderful undergrad students](https://dtr.northwestern.edu/projects/recpszo9ngYQ1ON9S).
-  [Orchestration Scripts](https://github.com/NUDelta/orchestration-engine): a platform for writing programs to guide situated action, powered by Organizational Objects that model the ways of working in a workplace. Published at CHI 2023.

Aside from workplace tools, I also worked on:
-  [Opportunistic Collective Experiences](https://github.com/NUDelta/ce-platform): location-based opportunistic interactions at locations around the world (e.g., two friends at a coffee shop sharing latte art). Published at CSCW 2020.
-  [4X](https://github.com/NUDelta/low-effort-sensing-ios): a hybrid approach for location-based data collection that leverages users' interest in collected data to elicit additional data contributions. Built as an iPhone and Apple Watch application for data sensing around college campuses. Published at CSCW 2019.

## ðŸ’½ Software projects
I love developing and maintaining free-to-use software systems, including:
- [Yellkey](https://www.yellkey.com/): an ephemeral URL to common English word shortener used by over 80,000 people a year.
- [Pair Research](https://www.pairresearch.io/) ([code](https://github.com/NUDelta/pair-research-meteor)): a platform for coordinating help requests in teams that over 1,300 people use at 130 groups in institutions around the world.

I also develop and maintain our website for [Delta Lab](https://delta.northwestern.edu/) ([code](https://github.com/NUDelta/delta-web)) and [Design, Technology, and Research (DTR)](https://dtr.northwestern.edu/) ([code](https://github.com/NUDelta/dtr-web))

## âš¡ Fun facts
I'm an avid [cook](https://www.instagram.com/kapil_garg/) and coffee geek. Love recommendations for restaurants, recipes, and coffee shops!

<!--
## Random software I like
Some random software I've had a lot of fun playing with:
- [Orchestration Script Abstract Syntax Tree Transformer](https://github.com/NUDelta/orchestration-scripts-ast-transformer): as AST-based code transformer using Babel that can allow people to write code at high-levels of abstraction and convert them into a form Orchestration Scripts could use.
